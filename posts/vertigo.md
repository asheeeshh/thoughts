the word *vertigo* is a very special word (one of my fav words), it's a rarely used word yet the meaning is beautiful. ig many people don't know it's meaning, even i didn't until i started listening to [EDEN](https://www.last.fm/music/Eden), before i knew i was completely obsessed with his music. one of his albums which i really like is named [vertigo](https://www.last.fm/music/Eden/vertigo). 

the meaning of vertigo according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo) is ~ *"a feeling which is not normal, but is rather abnormal where a person has the sensation of movement or of surrounding objects moving when they are not. often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement."*

i love this word as it has that myseterious vibe, it can be said in a lot of contexts, it can be used to describe something completely out of world, a feeling that's very rare and weird at the same time.
